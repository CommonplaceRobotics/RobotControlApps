# Control App Example
This sample shows how to control a robot via an app. Buttons in the app UI let the user start different actions.

The features shown in this sample are available from iRC V14-004 but the API (```AppClient.h```) will be updated for the newest feature set. Check the other samples for other features.

## Compiling
Read the [Building guide](../minimal_cpp/BUILDING.md) on how to compile C++ apps for Windows, Linux and Raspberry Pi (embedded robot control).
